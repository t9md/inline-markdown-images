# Note by t9md [START]

This is fork project, currently no published, just using locally.

- Load minimum code on startup to avoid Atom startup overhead.
- Render image at bellow of `![]()` link whereas upstream render image at `above` of link.
- Proper cleanup on deactivation.
- Relax img link detection to allow multiple image on single line or image wrapped by another link(e.g. CI badge image).
- Remove seem-to-unnecesesary styling: I don't want img centered etc.
- Code cleanup
